## 💼 What I'm Currently Building

- 🧾 **Full MERN Ticketing System**  
  Role-based access (student/staff/admin), rich comment threads, status workflows, image uploads via Cloudinary, JWT-based authentication with httpOnly cookies, and dynamic dashboards for staff.

- 🛒 **POS Inventory System (JavaFX)**  
  Desktop GUI application using Java, JavaFX, and Scene Builder. Features real-time inventory, cart/checkout flow, discounts, sales reports, receipt generation, and robust admin management.

- 💬 **Mini Chat App (MERN + Socket.io)**  
  Dedicated messenger for my circle of friends. Uses authentication, bcrypt security, Cloudinary for image hosting, JWT, and implements real-time chat features via Socket.io. The project’s main goal is to learn and deepen my understanding of WebSockets for live communication.

- Miscellaneous REST APIs and microservices for learning and experimentation.
