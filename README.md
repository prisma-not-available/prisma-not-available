# 👋 Yo, I'm Austin

I'm a student developer who actually knows what they're building (most of the time). I focus on **backend logic** and **full-stack applications** that don't fall apart in production. My journey: started with Java, fell into JavaScript, and now I'm cautiously optimistic about TypeScript.

## 💼 What I've Built

### 🛒 **POS & Inventory System** (JavaFX)
A desktop application that actually manages inventory without breaking. Built with Java, JavaFX, and Scene Builder. No database implemented tho. This is where I learned that not everything needs to be cloud-hosted.

### 🎓 **School Ticketing System** (MERN + TailwindCSS)
A full-stack solution for student concerns and administrative tasks. Features role-based access, JWT authentication with httpOnly cookies, rate limiting for API protection. Its a capstone proposal turned real.

### 💬 **Chat System** (MERN + WebSockets)
A simple messenger application where I first learned about WebSockets and real-time communication. No fancy features—just authentication, live messaging, and the satisfaction of seeing messages appear instantly.

### 📔 **Dev Diary** (MERN + TailwindCSS)
My personal development diary with authentication. This is where I experimented with **TanStack Query and mutations** for state management in React, moving beyond basic useState. Cloudinary integration is still in progress (but honestly, it's not urgent).

## 🚀 Currently Learning & Building

- **TypeScript**: Writing type-safe code and pretending to understand generics.
- **Next.js + PostgreSQL**: Planning my next full-stack adventure once I'm comfortable with TypeScript.
- **Better-Auth**: Using this auth helper to reduce my work in my future projects.
